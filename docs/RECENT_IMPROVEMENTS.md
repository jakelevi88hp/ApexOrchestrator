# Recent Improvements and Updates

This document outlines the recent improvements and updates made to the ApexOrchestrator project, based on the latest evaluation. These changes enhance the project's stability, test coverage, and documentation.

## 1. Dependency Management

### Added `numpy` to `requirements.txt`

To ensure a consistent and reproducible environment, the `numpy` dependency has been added to the `requirements.txt` file. The AGI module relies on `numpy` for various calculations, and this change ensures that the project can be set up and run without dependency issues.

This addresses a key recommendation from the recent project evaluation and improves the overall stability of the system.

## 2. Enhanced AGI Module Testing

### Comprehensive AGI Test Suite

A new, comprehensive test suite has been created for the AGI module (`tests/test_agi.py`). This suite includes over 20 tests covering the core AGI functionality, including:

*   **AGI Core:** Initialization, input processing, and goal setting.
*   **Consciousness Simulator:** Self-model creation and consciousness level management.
*   **Emotional Intelligence:** Emotion recognition and response.
*   **Reasoning Engine:** Logical and other reasoning capabilities.
*   **Creativity Engine:** Idea generation and creative problem-solving.

This extensive test suite significantly improves the robustness and reliability of the AGI module, which is a critical component of the ApexOrchestrator.

## 3. Expanded Documentation

### New Documentation and Updates

To keep the project's documentation up-to-date with the latest changes, the following updates have been made:

*   **New `RECENT_IMPROVEMENTS.md`:** This document provides a clear summary of the latest changes.
*   **Updated `README.md`:** The main `README.md` file has been updated to include information about the new AGI test suite.

These documentation updates make it easier for developers and users to understand the project's current state and how to contribute to its development.
